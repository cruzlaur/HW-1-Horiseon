Horiseon SEO Specialists Accessibility

Description:
My goal for this project was to assist the client, Horiseon SEO Specialists, in making their website more accessible. I had to adjust the html tags so that it was more readible to my fellow developers. Then I had to adjust the CSS accordingly so that it read the new tags to apply the styling. I also consolidated some of the CSS styling so that it applied multiple tags in the HTML without making the CSS too cumbersome and complicated. I also added comments to break up the HTML to make it more readable.
